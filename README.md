NFT Wallet is made for normal people to be able to hold nfts

The NFT Wallet can used to buy any NFT and hold it. It abstracts crypto private keys behind email and a passphrase which is the mnemonic. Using Circle's API the NFT wallet can be used to buy an NFT. Simply search and import the NFT from rarible and use wallet to buy NFT.

NFT Wallet also lets you know if a possible scam is in place by matching across a list of scammy smart contracts and by fetching some data from different databases.

Q: How will import work ? (Maybe use APIs or a graph)
